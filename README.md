## Setting Up GitHub Actions for Deployment

Automate your deployment process using GitHub Actions.

### Add Secrets to GitHub Repository:

1. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
2. Add the following secrets:
    - `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Your Vercel token.
    - `VERCEL_ORG_ID`: Your Vercel project name.
    - `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`: Found in your Vercel project's settings.
    - `API_KEY_DEV`: GitHub token for development branch previews.

### Create GitHub Action Workflow:

Create a new file at `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
    push:
        branches:
            - main # Production
            - dev # Preview

jobs:
    deploy:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
            - name: Check out code
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Set up Node.js
              uses: actions/setup-node@v2
              with:
                  node-version: '20'

            - name: Install dependencies
              run: npm install

            - name: Build project
              run: npm run build

            - name: Deploy to Vercel
              env:
                  VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
                  VERCEL_ORG_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_ORG_ID }}
                  VERCEL_PROJECT_ID: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_PROJECT_ID }}
                  API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY_DEV }}
              run: |
                  if [ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/main" ]; then
                    npx vercel --prod
                  else
                    npx vercel –pre
```

### Verify the Workflow:

1. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
2. The GitHub Action should trigger automatically on pushes to the `main` or `dev` branches.

---

## How the GitHub Action Works

The GitHub Action is designed to streamline the deployment process for your project. Here’s how it works:

### Triggering the Action:

-   The action is triggered automatically whenever changes are pushed to the `main` or `dev` branches of your GitHub repository.

### Branch-Specific Deployments:

1. **Main Branch:**

    - Changes in the `main` branch trigger a deployment to the **production environment** on Vercel.
    - This ensures that updates are reflected in the live, public-facing version of your application.

2. **Dev Branch:**
    - Changes in the `dev` branch trigger a deployment to the **preview environment** on Vercel.
    - This allows you to test and validate updates before merging them into the `main` branch.

### Steps in the Workflow:

1. **Check out code:**

    - The workflow fetches the latest version of your project from the GitHub repository.

2. **Set up Node.js:**

    - The Node.js environment is prepared to build and run your project.

3. **Install dependencies:**

    - All required packages are installed.

4. **Build project:**

    - The project is built using your defined build script.

5. **Deploy to Vercel:**
    - The project is deployed to Vercel using the appropriate environment (`production` or `preview`).

### Environment Variables and Secrets:

-   The workflow uses secrets stored in your GitHub repository (e.g., `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`) to authenticate and securely deploy your project.

---

## Additional Notes

### Finding Vercel IDs and Tokens:

-   **VERCEL_TOKEN:**
    -   Generate this in your Vercel account under **Settings > Tokens**.
-   **VERCEL_ORG_ID:**
    -   This is typically your Vercel username or team name.
-   **VERCEL_PROJECT_ID:**
    -   Found in your Vercel project under **Settings > General > Project ID**.

### Environment Variables in Vercel:

-   Ensure all environment variables are set for the correct environments (**Production**, **Preview**, **Development**).

### GitHub Actions Secrets:

-   Keep your secrets secure; do not commit them to your repository.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you have successfully:

1. Deployed your GitHub project to Vercel.
2. Configured environment variables.
3. Set up a PostgreSQL database or blob storage directly via the Vercel Storage tab.
4. Implemented continuous deployment with GitHub Actions.

With the GitHub Action in place:

-   Any updates pushed to the `dev` branch are automatically deployed to the **Preview environment** on Vercel, allowing you to test changes in an isolated environment.
-   Once the updates are ready for release, merging them into the `main` branch triggers a deployment to the **Production environment**, ensuring a seamless update to your live application.

For further assistance, refer to the [Vercel Documentation](https://vercel.com/docs) and the [GitHub Actions Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).
